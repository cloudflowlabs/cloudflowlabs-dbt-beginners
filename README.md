Would you rather just get started with dbt Cloud and skip the lab? [Just say hello and we'll take it from there.](https://getdbt.com/contact)


**TASK** - please do this one little thing:
- in your project, create a file called `packages.yml`. Place this file in the same folder as your `dbt_project.yml`, aka - in the root of the project.
- if you're not able to add or edit files, make sure you're not on the `main` branch of your project - check the big green button in the editor at the top left under `Version Control`. If it prompts you to create a branch, go ahead and do that now and try again.
- Paste in the following yaml and then save the file. Don't forget to save!!

```yaml
packages:
  - git: https://github.com/dbt-labs/2023-04-18---zero-to-dbt.git
```
- When you save `packages.yml` (do NOT forget to save this file hahaha), you'll see an error in the editor. That is NORMAL - all part of the process ðŸ¤˜
- An alert should pop up asking you to run `dbt deps`. Please click it. Deps = dependencies. It'll install the base project for today's session.
- If you don't see a form pop up, don't panic. In the dbt command line at the bottom of the IDE, go ahead and run `dbt deps`.
- If you have any issues, we'll help you - just let us know in the chat.

From here, it's smooth sailing â›µ - we'll work through everything together LIVE.

And just like before, we'll send recordings for this portion

## Section 3 - free play!
Let's do something fun with the new tools you have. Take a look at the dbt Docs we just built and see if you can find something interesting to build.

Here are the ground rules:
- build for your curiosity - not for your job
- start small. Preview data, ask a question, get an answer, ask a new question, repeat ðŸ”„
- Starving for inspiration? Check out kaggle.com for CSV data sets - download, drop in your `seeds` directory, and run `dbt seed` to get started

We'll spend some time letting folks work and doing open Q&A.
